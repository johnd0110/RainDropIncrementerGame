This is a basic Incrementer game (Numbers Go Up, Idle Game, Etc.) using Rain as a concept. Built using only built-in Python Libraries, primarily tkinter.

Current Features:
- Procedurally-generated animated Rain clouds which randomly roam horizontally across the game window.
  - Rain clouds are procedurally generated by doing a random walk around the perimeter of an invisible rectangle and drawing arcs between each step.
- Rain Drop Animations when incrementing the rain drop count
- Thunder Animations when a certain level of rain drop generation rate is reached
